# Open SSTP Client for Android <img src="https://github.com/kittoku/Open-SSTP-Client/raw/main/images/icon.png" height="40">
This is an open-sourced Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (MS-SSTP) client for Android, developed for accessing to 
[VPN Azure Cloud](https://www.vpnazure.net/) (or [SoftEther VPN Server](https://www.softether.org/)). 
So no test with other servers is done. Its behavior may be still unstable.

## Installation
You can download and install the latest version via [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kittoku.osc).
Some of previous versions are released as apk file on [the releases page](https://github.com/kittoku/Open-SSTP-Client/releases).

## Usage
Enter `Host`, `Username` and `Password` preferences and turn the switch on. If a key icon gets to show on 
the right side of the status bar, establishing a VPN connection has been succeeded. To disconnect 
the connection, turn the switch off in the home tab or tap the notification. You can save/load the 
profile from the upper-right option menu.

## Setting tab
Some settings to be noted are written below:

### Add Trusted Certificates (SSL Layer)
If you choose a certain directory, the client uses ONLY certificates in the directory, but the default 
certificate store. I made this option for debugging. 

### PPP Network Protocol
You can choose what network protocol PPP layer tries enabling. Remember, IPv6 option just gives the device 
a link local address, never guarantees that you can communicate perfectly with IPv6 protocol.

### Custom DNS Server Address
You can specify DNS server to use in this option. Packets associated with this address is routed to 
the VPN tunnel. If you specify a IPv4(v6) address and disable IPv4(v6) network,
domain names possibly cannot be resolved.

### Enable App-Based Rule
With `Select Allowed Apps` option, you can specify the apps which use the VPN tunnel.
Even allowed apps cannot use the VPN tunnel if their routes are not on the routing table.
So when you use this option, enabling `Add Default Route` option is recommended.


## Notice
* `Host` preference can also contain IP address, but cannot include a port number. You can configure it in
the setting tab.

* Your device needs to install a self-signed certificate and
 disable `Verify Hostname` option to access to a server using it
 
* A server must enable DHCP
 
* Only **PAP** and **MS-CHAPv2** authentication protocols can be enabled. No EAP. 
 
## Debugging
It is almost impossible that I can debug a problem caused in any environments but my own. In a networking
app, there are many possible reasons to cause the problem and I cannot identify the real one unless the 
problem can be reproduced in my environment.

So it is strongly encouraged that you should debug by yourself. With `Select Cipher Suites` option, this client tries 
to use `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA` or `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA` as a cipher suite so that you 
can decrypt and investigate packets with software like WireShark. I think there can be a similar app for 
Android. Don't forget the great software, Android Studio and its emulator (v^ー°)

I don't have Windows Server OS. So I don't officially support accessing to it, but there is a
 successful case. See [this issue](https://github.com/kittoku/Open-SSTP-Client/issues/8#issuecomment-590241322).
